		<h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROVINCE OF
SOUTHERN LEYTE</h1>
	</center>
	<p>Southern Leyte shares a common past with Leyte, its mother province.  Since the discovery of the Philippines on March 16, 1521, by Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator in the service of the Spanish crown, up to June 30, 1960, the history of the province has been closely woven into the historical fabric of the mother province.</p><br>
	<p>Recorded history for both Leyte and Southern Leyte started when Ferdinand Magellan noted in his logbook the sighting of the island of Homonhon on March 16, 1521.  Twelve days later, on March 28, 1521, Magellan and his men landed in Limasawa, an island measuring 640 hectares at the southern tip of Leyte mainland.</p><br>
	<p>On this island, Magellan met Rajah Kolambu, the native ruler, and his brother Rajah Siagu, the chieftain of Butu in Mindanao.  The first recorded blood compact or treaty of friendship between Rajah Kolambu and Magellan took place on this island.  The island, however, owes its prominent spot in history as the place where the First Mass in the Philippines was celebrated.  Shortly after the mass, Magellan planted a cross on a hilltop and took possession of the territory in the name of Spain.</p><br>
	<p>During the Spanish colonial era, there already existed some kind of a “sub-province” of Leyte consisting of the western and southern towns of Palompon up to Hinunangan, including the towns in Panaon Island, with Maasin as the center. A court of First Instance and Provincial Treasurer (Administrador de Hacienda) held offices in Maasin.  (Source:  Southern Leyte: The People, the Land and the Sea of First, Copyright @ 1997 by Joaquin Gonzales Chung, Jr.)</p><br>
	<p>The Court of First Instance, then known as the Promoter Fiscal, is the court where all minor administrative and other cases from Palompon to Hinunangan were heard and decided upon. With the change of sovereignty from Spanish to American, the established offices, except the Court of First Instance, were reverted back to Tacloban.</p><br>
	<p>Because of the distance from Tacloban and poor road conditions, travel and business transactions with the provincial capital were extremely difficult. These were the main reasons why the Cebuano-speaking western Leyteños strongly pursued their separation from the Waray-waray-speaking eastern Leyteños.  Prominent leaders of the west coast rallied the people’s desire for the division of Leyte Province.  From 1915 up to its division in 1960, the subject was always a nagging issue in every election.  Local politicians’ careers hang on their stand on the issue and on their performance in making this dream a reality.</p><br><br><br>

	<p>In 1919, Representative Ciriaco K. Kangleon, Second Legislative District of Leyte (Inopacan-Cabalian) sponsored a Bill to divide Leyte.  The Bill hurdled the House of Representatives but failed to get the Senate’s approval by just one vote.</p><br>
	<p>In 1922, Representative Tomas Oppus of the Second District of Leyte presented House Bill 254 which became Act No. 3117 of the Philippine Legislature. The law provides for the division of Leyte into two, where the municipalities from Villaba to Hinunangan shall comprise the new Occidental Leyte. The law however was never proclaimed by then Governor-General Leonard Wood rendering it invalid.</p><br>
	<p>In 1930, Act No. 3788 was passed redistricting Leyte province into five representative districts.  The towns of Villaba and Palompon, which were part of Occidental Leyte under Act 3117, were grouped with other municipalities of Oriental Leyte under Act 3788.    Act 3788 could not be proclaimed because a representative district would extend from Oriental Leyte to Occidental Leyte (under Act 3117), which is not allowed under the constitution.</p><br>
	<p>On October 28, 1944, Mayor Alfredo K. Bantug of Maasin resurrected the issue of the provincial division. He caused the Municipal Council of Maasin to pass Resolution No. 60 requesting President Sergio Osmeña to proclaim Act No. 3117.  When he became president of Leyte’s League of Municipal Mayors, he called all the municipal mayors of Leyte to a convention held in Maasin on December 7, 1955, to discuss the matter of two Leyte provinces.  In the said convention, 39 mayors who attended voted in favor of the division with the mountain ranges as the demarcation lines.</p><br>
	<p>With the League’s resolution on hand, the Maasin Municipal Council sent a delegation to Manila in 1956 to inform Leyte Representatives of the people’s desire to divide Leyte province and to present a division Bill in Congress.  The delegation was composed of Mayor A.K. Bantug, Councilmen Dr. Teofilo Ampil, and Atty. Bernardino Demeterio.</p><br>
	<p>As a result of the delegation’s mission, a Bill was presented in the lower House co-sponsored by then Congressmen Francisco Pajao and Alberto Agujo.  Congressman Pajao however withdrew the Bill when Senate Bill 2124, presented by Senator Ruperto K. Kangleon, was passed in the Senate.  However, Sec. 18 of Art. VI of the 1935 Constitution stipulates that all Bills of local application which involve appropriation should emanate or be filed first at the Lower House.  With the Bill in the lower House withdrawn by Cong. Pajao, the Kangleon Bill was once again shelved due to noncompliance with the abovementioned Constitutional provision.</p><br>
	<p>In 1957, Congressman Nicanor E. Yñiguez of the 3rd District, filed a Bill in the House co-authored by Cong. Veloso of the 5th District and Speaker Daniel Romualdez of the 4th District. The Bill proposed the creation of a new province to be known as Western Leyte, to embrace all the municipalities of the 2nd and 3rd congressional districts of Leyte, except Ormoc City, with Maasin as the capital of the new province.  However, Cong. Dominador Tan, whose congressional district was affected, did not favor the Bill.  With this predicament, Cong. Yñiguez abandoned the Bill.</p><br>
	<p>On April 15, 1958, Cong. Yñiguez filed House Bill No. 1318.  The proposed Bill provided for a limited geographic coverage area for the new province to be established under the Third Congressional District.  The Bill covered the municipalities of Maasin up to Silago, including the towns on Panaon Island. With a much reduced geographic scope, the Bill was approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate on May 2, 1958, and May 16, 1959, respectively.</p><br><br><br>

	<p>On May 22, 1959, at 10:10 o’clock in the morning, President Carlos P. Garcia signed R.A. 2227, an Act Creating the Province of Southern Leyte, into law at Malacañang, Manila.  Provincial personalities present and witnesses to the signing included Congressman Nicanor E. Yñiguez, Mayor Alfredo K. Bantug, Atty. Manuel Enage, Sr., Ms. Erlinda Capili, and Atty. Floro Kangleon (Son of former Representative Ciriaco K. Kangleon ).</p><br>
	<p>The new province of Southern Leyte was inaugurated on July 1, 1960.   The newly-established province was composed of sixteen (16) municipalities, 349 barangays, and 4 islands (Panaon, Limasawa, San Pablo, and San Pedro).  The municipalities included: Macrohon, Padre Burgos, Malitbog, Bontoc, Sogod, Libagon, Liloan, Pintuyan, San Francisco, St. Bernard, Cabalian (now San Juan), Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan, Silago, and Maasin, the capital town and the seat of the provincial government.</p><br><br><br>

	<p>The newly-appointed Governor, in his Autobiography, described the atmosphere during their oath-taking celebration as “very pompous and enjoyable, which can easily prophesy that unity is forthcoming.”</p><br>
	<p>Over the years, three more municipalities were subsequently created bringing the total number of municipalities to the current 19.  The new municipalities added were: San Ricardo from Pintuyan, Tomas Oppus from Malitbog, and Limasawa from Padre Burgos.</p><br>
	<p>On February 1, 2019, R.A. 11198, or An Act Providing for the Reapportionment of the Province of Southern Leyte into Two Legislative Districts, authored by then Congressman Damian G. Mercado, was approved and signed into law by then President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.</p><br>
	<p>The first district is comprised of seven (7) LGUs, namely: the City of Maasin, Macrohon, Padre Burgos, Limasawa, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, and Bontoc.</p><br>
	<p>The second district is comprised of 12 LGUs, namely: Sogod, Libagon, Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan, San Ricardo, St. Bernard, San Juan, Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan, and Silago.</p><br>
	<p>As of February 15, 1960, Southern Leyte had a total population of 209,608 according to the NSO Census of Population.</p><br><br><br>
