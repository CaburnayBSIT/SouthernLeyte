	<h1><strong>ECONOMY</strong></h1>
	<p>Southern Leyte’s economy is agriculture-based, anchored on two (2) major crops, coconut and palay.  Various crops, fruits vegetables and flowers are suitable in the province but area harvested is minimal and not in commercial scale. The total area harvested in Southern Leyte shows a decreasing trend.   The decrease is attributed to the occurrence of natural calamities like typhoons, flooding and drought due to climate change.</p>
	<p>Southern Leyte is classified as a third class province.</p><br><br><br>
	<h3>COCONUT</h3>
	<p>In 2020, Southern Leyte has a total coconut area of 32,168 hectares.  Maasin City had the highest land area planted to coconut with 5,587.44 hectares representing 17% share in land area planted to coconut.  All the other municipalities had less than 10% share in the total land area planted to coconut. Total number of trees reported in 2020 is placed at almost 8 million with Maasin City having a little over 1 million coconut trees (13% share) and followed by Silago with about 80 thousand trees (10% share).   All the other municipalities had less than 10% share in the total number of coconut trees.  Total coconut production in 2020 was placed at 128,623 MT (nuts with husks). There are a total of 46,792 coconut farmers in the entire province. (PSA, 2020)</p>
	<p>Super Typhoon Odette, which hit Southern Leyte on December 16, 2021, damaged about 6 million trees (3 million totally and 3 million were partially damaged).  Experts believe that it will take at least 5 years for the province’s coconut industry to fully recover and be restored to its pre-Odette state.</p>
	<h3>PALAY</h3>
	<p>Palay is the other major crop produced in the province.  As of 2022, Southern Leyte has a total of 6,959 hectares of palay areas of which 88.11% (6,132 hectares) is irrigated.  Hinunangan has the highest irrigated palay area with 1,261 hectares followed by St. Bernard, with 1,122 hectares.  The total land area planted to palay is down from 8,245 hectares recorded in 2017.  (PAGSO)  </p>
	<p>The municipality with the highest percentage share of area planted to palay is Hinunangan with (20.85%), followed by St. Bernard (16.41%), Sogod (9.20%), Bontoc (9.13%) and Maasin City (7.69%).  The two municipalities in the province that have no palay areas are Limasawa and San Ricardo.  </p>
	<p>The province has 740 hectares palay areas that are rainfed.  LGUs with the highest rainfed palay areas are Maasin City and Hinunangan with 190 hectares each.  Rainfed areas in the rest of the municipalities ranged from 5 to 81.5 hectares.</p>
	<h3>ABACA</h3>
	<p>Abaca used to be one of the major crops and a major source of employment and income for many Southern Leyteños. The province was once the top producer of quality abaca fiber in Region 8 before the abaca bunchy top disease infestation. The abaca varieties found in the province include: Laylay, Inosa, Linawaan, Linlay, Putian, Laguis, Linlib and Linino.</p>
	<p>Abaca fiber is in demand globally as a raw material for coarse and stiff clothing, foot wear and cordage, textile, handicraft and specialty paper products like tea bags, sausage casings, cigarette papers, non-woven and disposables and as natural fiber material for dashboards and car interiors.  Markets of Southern Leyte abaca fiber included the local abaca handicrafts processors in the province, whose workers were mostly women as well as the pulp, paper and cordage factories in Manila, Cebu, Iligan, and Bicol.</p>
	<p>The bunchy top virus started to infest abaca farms in 2000, killing about 80% of the abaca plants, and forced the abaca farmers to engage in other crops such as bananas, camote, cassava, yautea and vegetables to survive. </p>
	<p>Efforts of the Provincial Government of Southern Leyte and Phil-FIDA to revive the abaca industry in the province is continuing.  As of 2022, 40,000 abaca suckers were planted in 15 abaca nurseries established by the Provincial Government in 11 LGUs.  The goal is to propagate disease-free abaca suckers for massive distribution to interested farmers province-wide.  In 2021, the Provincial Government started the implementation of Coconut-based abaca production in 9 LGUs where 93,796 abaca suckers were planted. A total of 23,100 newly-delivered suckers intended for planting in 7 more LGUs were destroyed during the onslaught of Typhoon Odette in December 16, 2021.</p>
	<h3>FISHING</h3>
	<p>Fishing is also a major source of livelihood of the majority of the people living in 255 coastal barangays of the province.  The province’s major marine fishing grounds are the Hinunangan Bay, Sogod Bay and Cabalian Bay.  Its municipal water area total about 260,679 hectares (NAMRIA, 2017). Fish species caught include skip jack tuna, striped mackerel, Spanish mackerel, round scads, anchovies, sardines and flying fish. Lobsters, shrimps, prawns, crabs, shellfish and mussels.</p>
	<p>Super Typhoon Odette, that landed in Southern Leyte on December 16, 2021, damaged 8,287 motorized and non-motorized boats. As of 2022, there are 24,900 registered fisher folks, 6,190 registered motorized boats and 10 registered commercial boats operating in the province.  (BFAR)</p>
	<p>The province’s fisher folks are engaged in various types of fishing:  commercial, marine municipal, inland municipal and aqua-culture.  They used different types of passive and active fishing gears based on such as gill net, scoop net, beach seine, bottom set gill net, ring net, fish corral, fish pen, fish pot/trap, hook and line, jigger, gleaning, needle fish fishing, pole and line, spears/spear gun, trammel net, super light, and troll line.  However, fish catch is getting smaller each year and could not meet the provincial demand.  The decreasing fish catch is attributed to various factors, including the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p>To improve coastal and marine productivity for the fishery sector, the LGUs in Southern Leyte established marine protected areas (MPAs).  As of 2022, 82 sites with an aggregate area of 1,400.64 hectares are declared for protection composing of coral reefs, sea grass beds and mangrove ecosystems.  In cognizance of the importance of mangrove forest in maintaining balance in the ecological environment, the Provincial Government embarked on the production and distribution of mangrove and beach trees seedlings to increase the forest cover in the coastal zone.  Fourteen out of the 18 municipalities and one city with mangrove areas have continuously planted and maintained their reforestation sites.</p><br><br><br>
